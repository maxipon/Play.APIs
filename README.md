# Play

## Description

This project is a collection of services and frameworks designed to facilitate communication between the Catalog and Inventory services throughout REST APIs. It includes the following components:

- **Play.Infra**: Contains the `docker-compose.yaml` file to help develop and run the application locally.
- **Play.Frontend**: A simple template for the frontend, which uses the Catalog and Inventory services and is written in Node.js.
- **Play.Common**: A simple framework that initializes the connection to MongoDB and helps communicate between the Catalog and Inventory services.
- **Play.Inventory**: Defines the Inventory Entities and its Services.
- **Play.Catalog**: Defines the Catalog Entities, its Contracts, and its Services.
